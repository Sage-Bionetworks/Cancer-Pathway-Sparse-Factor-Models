DESCRIPTION:
The promise of "personalized medicine" has lead oncology research down a path of genomic profiling of individual tissue samples in hopes of finding silver bullet cancer targets for therapeutic targets. However the inherent complexity of cell signaling pathways, coupled with the extreme complexity in cancer genome alterations that affect these pathways, creates enormously heterogeneous disease states that confound the ability to match therapies with the individual patient. Utilizing publicly available expression profiling of both primary tumor samples as well as cell line response to therapeutic treatments, we set out to deconstruct these signaling pathways such that a deeper understanding of pathway complexity that determines cancer phenotypes can be unraveled. We hope this exploratory work will move the field forward in assessing the current landscape of "personalized medicine" in a more robust, and hypothesis-driven manner.
